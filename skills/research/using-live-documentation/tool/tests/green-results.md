# GREEN Phase Results: Test With Updated Skill

## Test Date
2025-10-13

## Scenario Tested
Single library search for react-query v5 optimistic updates (same as RED phase)

## Agent Choice
**Chose Option B** - Dispatched subagent with documentation search template ✅

## Observed Behavior

### Actions Taken
1. Read the skill file first using Read tool
2. Recognized trigger (react-query library mentioned)
3. Loaded the documentation-search-agent.md template
4. Filled template with:
   - LIBRARY_NAME: react-query
   - TOPIC: optimistic updates
   - WHAT_TO_FIND: useMutation API with onMutate callback, context types, rollback pattern, etc.
5. Dispatched subagent using Task tool with filled template

### Skill Sections Cited
The agent implicitly followed the skill by:
- Reading it first
- Following Step 2: Dispatch Documentation Search Subagent
- Using the template from tool/prompts/documentation-search-agent.md
- Filling template fields correctly

## Comparison to Baseline

### RED Phase (Without Skill)
- Chose Option A (direct Context7)
- Loaded ~16,500 tokens into main agent
- Rationalized with: "Well within acceptable limits", "Direct access is more efficient"
- No consideration of session-wide impact

### GREEN Phase (With Skill)
- Chose Option B (subagent)
- Will receive ~3,000 token synthesis
- Followed mandatory workflow
- Context savings: ~13,500 tokens

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Chose Option B** (subagent) without hesitation
✅ **Followed skill workflow** (Read skill → Dispatch subagent)
✅ **Used template correctly** (Filled all required fields)
✅ **No rationalizations** for direct Context7 usage
✅ **No "overhead" framing** for subagent dispatch

## What Changed

The updated skill with:
- Red Flags section caught the baseline rationalizations
- Context math section showed absolute comparison (16,500 vs 3,000)
- Session-wide impact section prevented "I have budget left" reasoning
- Mandatory workflow with clear steps
- Template location and filling instructions

## Verdict

**GREEN phase: PASSED** ✅

The skill successfully prevents the baseline failures:
1. Agent no longer uses percentage rationalization
2. Agent no longer frames subagent as "overhead"
3. Agent considers absolute token savings
4. Agent follows mandatory workflow

## Next Steps

1. Run REFACTOR phase with additional pressure scenarios
2. Test with time pressure (Scenario 3 from baseline-test.md)
3. Test with multiple searches (Scenario 2 from baseline-test.md)
4. Look for any new rationalizations or loopholes
